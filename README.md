# placeholder-edittext

Link a `hint` but keeps showing as you type.

I've seen a few libs out there that but I wasn't happy with their implementation. This lib:
- Renders the placeholder seperatly from the text, so `getText()` is always what the user entered
- Supports custom spans for the placeholder
